## My Daily Tab
A web application made to deal with the problem that I personally have where I end up with over 400+ tabs on mobile and also with 20+ tabs on my laptop

Mainly caused by my need to hoard and also store interesting information so I won't forget and can reference them whenever

~~I could use bookmarks but my bookmarks tend to be forgotten and left to rot T_T~~

#Update (December 2025):

I will still work on this project but admittedly, I don't think it will help much with my tab hoarding issue
I think I might just need to accept it and move on T_T
